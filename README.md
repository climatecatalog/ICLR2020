TITLE: Climate Catalog - Accelerated Data Discovery for Scalable Climate Action
ABSTRACT:
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the planet must decarbonize by 50% by 2030 in order to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees C. This goal calls for a prompt and massive deployment of solutions in all societal sectors - research, governance, finance, commerce, health care, consumption. One challenge for experts and non-experts is access to relevant information, which is currently scattered across many weakly linked domains of expertise, and is growing rapidly. We propose a large-scale, semi-automatic, AI-based discovery system to collect, tag, and semantically index this information. The ultimate goal is a near real-time, partially curated data catalog of global climate information for rapidly scalable climate action.

THIS PROJECT:
Demonstrate the concept of Climate Catalog by matching Funders to Founders in the Regenerative Space.
(1) Semantically tag (classify) and cluster the funders and founders in given lists.
(2) Match the funders and founders - verify by expert curation.
(3) Find funders and founders not on the lists.
